# AstroSim

Scripts and python notebooks created for researching the efficacy of ScopeSim in use for planning research at the ELT.

Authored by Kristen E Gardner during the completion of a masters thesis.

# Usage

The python notebooks are mostly scratch, the functionality resulting from this project is more or less contained within the script files found in `.\scripts\`.

Before running the scripts, install the package dependencies (preferably in a venv):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `data` file is a sqlite3 db which contains data used in some scripts.

Python 3.12 is the latest version that has been tested to work with the packages used by the scripts.
